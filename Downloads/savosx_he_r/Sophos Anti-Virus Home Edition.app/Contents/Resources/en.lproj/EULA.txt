14.3 (i) Self-Audits. To help manage Licensee’s use of the Products and Licensee’s compliance with this Agreement, Licensee agrees to perform a self-audit upon ten (10) working days’ prior written notice from Sophos, calculating the number of Users, Computers, Servers or other applicable units benefiting from the Products. If Licensee’s self-audit reveals that Licensee’s actual usage exceeds the License Entitlement, Licensee shall procure the additional licenses required from Sophos or its preferred Partner. (ii) Formal Audits. If Licensee does not perform a self-audit upon request from Sophos, or if Sophos has reason to doubt the results of such self-audit, upon prior written notice to Licensee, Licensee shall permit Sophos or an independent certified accountant appointed by Sophos to access Licensee’s premises and inspect Licensee’s books of account and records at any time during normal business hours for the purpose of inspecting, auditing, verifying or monitoring the manner and performance of Licensee’s obligations under this License Agreement, including without limitation the payment of all applicable license fees. Any such audit shall minimize the disruption to Licensee’s business operations.  Sophos shall not be able to exercise this right more than once in each calendar year. If an audit reveals that Licensee has underpaid fees to Sophos, Licensee shall be invoiced for and shall pay to Sophos or the Partner (as applicable) within thirty (30) days of the date of invoice an amount equal to the shortfall between the fees due and those paid by Licensee. If the amount of the underpayment exceeds five percent (5%) of the fees due or the audit reveals a violation of any license restrictions pursuant to this License Agreement then, without prejudice to Sophos’s other rights and remedies, Licensee shall also pay Sophos’s reasonable costs of conducting the audit.
14.4 Sophos may in its sole discretion assign, novate, subcontract or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder.
14.5 Sophos may amend the terms and conditions of this License Agreement and/or any documents and policies referenced herein at any time, including without limitation by posting revised terms and conditions on its website at <http://www.sophos.com/en-us/legal> and/or the location of such document or policy. Such amended terms and conditions shall be binding upon Licensee with effect from the date of such change. For the avoidance of doubt, such amended terms and conditions shall supersede any prior version of the License Agreement which may have been embedded in or packaged with the Product itself.
14.6 Failure by either party to enforce any particular term or condition of this License Agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of any of its rights under it.
14.7 The illegality, invalidity or unenforceability of any part of this License Agreement will not affect the legality, validity or enforceability of the remainder.
14.8 If Licensee and Sophos have signed a separate written agreement covering the licensing and use of the Product, the terms and conditions of such signed agreement shall take precedence over any conflicting terms and conditions of this License Agreement. Otherwise this License Agreement, the Schedule and the documents and policies referenced herein constitute the entire agreement between the parties relating to the licensing and use of the Product and supersede any other oral or written communications, agreements or representations with respect to the Product, except for any oral or written communications, agreements or representations made fraudulently. The UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall not apply.
14.9 If there are any inconsistencies between the English language version of this License Agreement and any translated version, the English language version shall prevail.

The federal and state courts of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, U.S.A. shall have exclusive jurisdiction to determine any dispute or claim which may arise out of, under, or in connection with this License Agreement.  The parties waive any right to a jury trial in any litigation arising out of or in connection with this License Agreement; and
ANY OTHER COUNTRY, this License Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with it, including without limitation non-contractual disputes or claims, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales, without regard to conflict of laws principles.
