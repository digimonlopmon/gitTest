*************************************************


First, you MUST have the Istripper/Basic folder. DO NOT Change that One.

Go to USER/AppData/Local/VGHD/DATA/Skins/iStripper/

The Melena Folder is Ideal to Use to Experiment with. Make a Copy and Rename it.

Make a Copy of It, and Keep it as a backup.

In this example, new folder has been named "Tutorial"

So you have a new folder 
VGHD/DATA/Skins/iStripper/Tutorial
Which is a copy of the Melena Folder

There are Only 4 Files in that Folder : 

	1- description.txt
	2- img_left.jpg
	3- skinThumbnail.png
	4- palette.txt


1- In description.txt you can setup the maximum length of the left border of the GUI. By default it's 270 pixels.

2- img_left.jpg is the SKIN. It's the big image that you see on the Left side of the GUI.

3- skinThumbnail is the small preview (70 x 128) of your skin visible in iStripper setting.

4- Palette.txt is a simple text file with named variables followed by the RGB hex Color Codes.

Palette.txt allows you to change practically all colors used in GUI. 
In palette.txt, each line is annotated with the description of the corresponding color in the GUI.



The Palette.txt file has a color variable in it named dark. This color controls the Color around the Outer Edges of the GUI.
It is Applied as a gradient, over top of the img_left.jpg
The Gradient runs from 100% Transparent to 100% Opacity and the size of the gradient is controlled by the size of the img_left.jpg.

Along the top of the GUI, a menu bar of 62 Pixels tall is where the Dark color is most noticable.

The Gradient ALWAYS starts 270 pixels from the left side of the GUI, and runs to the RIGHT edge of the img_left.jpg.
By changing the width of this image, you can control how much gradient your skin will have in the top menu bar.

Also, the same gradient is applied to the bottom 130 Pixels of the img_left.jpg
So by Changing the height of this image, you can control where the bottom gradient starts.

Don't change the name of the variables. Only change the color codes.
Make Sure they are a 6 digit HEX value. and start with a Hash Tag
#RRGGBB where RR is the Value of RED, GG is the Value of GREEN and BB is the Value o BLUE
