 - RC1

April 1, 2014 Update:
 - RC0 Win32 code and universal content build

March 7, 2014 Update:
 - Fixed an input bug. Stubbed out Steamworks integration in case the game gets Greenlit any time soon.

February 17, 2014 Update:
 - Removed NERD engine features for parity with NFML builds. Added Playable Cat DLC.

October 24, 2013 Update 2:
 - Fixed a bug in where jumping into a moving platform could cause the player to vanish from the world.

October 24, 2013 Update:
 - Modified a number of shaders to include explicit casts so that GLSL doesn't choke on them.
 - Use previous velocity for testing effects threshold on landing. This is a better fix for landing effects that doesn't break ceiling collision. >_<
 - Fixed Xbox 360 gamepad buttons not showing up in the bindings screen.

October 16, 2013 Update:
 - Updated Bramble Patcher to version 1.2. This may fix the partially downloaded file bug.

October 10, 2013 Update 2:
 - Fixed audio and particle effects not playing on landing after walking off or falling through a platform.

October 10, 2013 Update:
 - Replaced a couple of SwitchToThread() calls with Sleep() calls in the streaming audio and stat logging threads. This should alleviate some CPU thrashing caused by allowing these threads to spin idly.

October 8, 2013 Update:
 - Added Accept-Encoding and TE headers to HTTP requests to indicate acceptable response formats. May address failed checksums when patching, although I have not been able to reproduce that behavior locally, so it's really a shot in the dark.

October 6, 2013 Update 5:
 - Fixed a bug where patch notes were being duplicated across multiple patches. (Echo echo echo...)

October 6, 2013 Update 4:
 - Fixed a one-frame bug where the player character would appear before the title screen.
 - Fixed a crash in YHtWtG introduced by the last patch.

October 6, 2013 Update 3:
 - Fixed a one-frame bug where the player character would appear before the title screen.
 - Fixed a bug that could cause a crash, hang, or flickering/resetting device due to the game window losing focus at startup.

October 6, 2013 Update 2:
 - Default to FXAA off for now, since shader model requirements are apparently not being tested/reported correctly.
 - Fixed a bug that could cause a crash, hang, or flickering/resetting device due to the game window losing focus at startup.

October 6, 2013 Update:
 - Not quite ready to support the Rift yet in YHtWtG.
 - Removed some console commands that don't do anything yet and/or are only needed for debugging.
 - Default to FXAA off for now, since shader model requirements are apparently not being tested/reported correctly.

October 1, 2013 Update 2:
 - Not quite ready to support the Rift yet in YHtWtG.

October 1, 2013 Update:
 - Fixed a bug where the campaign selection menu would show the wrong number of pages in some cases.
 - More generalizations for future projects. Collision components can now contain an arbitrary set of primitives. Will likely require more work to resolve collision properly when sweeping multi-primitive entities, but since all the entities in YHtWtG have only one primitive, this hasn't been an issue yet.
 - More updates to play nice with recent engine changes.
 - Fixed a bug with screenshot format being ignored.
 - Fixed a few bugs related to recent engine changes.
 - Added a brightness calibration image.

July 30, 2013 Update:
 - Fixed a bug in which streaming audio would not reset properly after playing to completion.
 - Lots of work under the hood to facilitate easier development of future titles. Probably won't break YHtWtG. ^_^;
 - Fixed a bug where the campaign selection menu would show the wrong number of pages in some cases.

July 24, 2013 Update:
 - Added support for automatically generating patch notes from checkin comments.

 - Made changes to build process.

July 23, 2013 Update:
 - Added UI polish, fixed Twitter link, and added support for different screenshot formats.

July 22, 2013 Update:
 - Fixed the bug where the player becomes ungrounded when the game is paused.

 - Porting recent engine improvements back to YHtWtG.

July 5, 2013 Update 2:
 - Engine tweaks.

July 5, 2013 Update:
 - Uninstaller will no longer delete adjacent files. It is still recommended to install the game into a fresh folder, however.

 - Added YOLO mode.

April 27, 2013 Update 2:
 - Fixed another rendering bug.

June 7, 2012 Update:
 - Made Kanji a default key for opening the console.

June 4, 2012 Update:
 - Allowing pause to be unbound is disastrous. Don't do that!
