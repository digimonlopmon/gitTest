Moirai README
-------------------------------

Moirai is an exprimental game made by Chris Johnson, Brad Barrett and John
Oestmann. The game is very much a concept piece, in that it's just about 
conveying an idea. In order to appreciate this idea you should play the game.
There is an FAQ section at the bottom of this file that you may be interested
in reading after playing.

This game started as a game for the second seven day first person shooter jam.
However it took a little while longer to see the entire game through. It's
inspired by the amazing, interactive thearte performance called A Game of You by
Ontroerend Goed.

FAQs
...............

What exactly is going on in the game?

As you enter the cave for the first time you run into the previous player of the
game. They answer your questions based upon what they entered when they finished
their game. That is the only major influence they have on your game.

The confrontation with Julia at the end of cave always ends in the same way, you 
have blood on your hands. When you leave the cave you run into a farmer who asks
you three questions. This farmer is a stand in for the next player of the game.
The next player of the game may choose to ask you no questions and just let you
pass.

Once the next player finishes the game you should receive an email describing.
It'll describe the decisions the next player made when choosing your fate. What
this also means is that the previous player from your game knows what exactly
you did to them.

_______________________________


What happens if two people start the game at the same time?

At the start of the game you are paired with a past player whose fate hasn't
been decided. If two people are paired with the same person then the fate of
the previous player will be decided by the first player to finish.

This also means that you can play the game twice in a row and not run into your
past self.
