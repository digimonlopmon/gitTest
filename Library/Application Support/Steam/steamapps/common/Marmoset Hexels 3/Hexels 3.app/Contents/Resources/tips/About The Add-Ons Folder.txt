This folder can be used to add default options to Hexels, such as glow patterns, custom shapes, and textures.
They will be available within the application in the same places as those supplied by Marmoset.
You'll need to restart Hexels for it to recognize anything you add here.

For document templates, you'll want (but not NEED) three files:
myTemplate.hxl (your template document.  You do actually need this one.)
myTemplate.png (256 x 256 pixel preview image.  Optional.)
myTemplate.txt (a description.  Also optional.)

Adding blending and post processing shaders is a little more complicated, but if you have a little knowlege of
GLSL, it should be relatively easy to add your effects to Hexels.  Check out our tutorial at:
