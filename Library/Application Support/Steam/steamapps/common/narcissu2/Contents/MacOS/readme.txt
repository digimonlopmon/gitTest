 1. INTRODUCTION

Thank you for downloading this English edition of Narcissu Side 2nd!


 2. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

The formal requirements are:

  Pentium 2 or better processor
  Microsoft Windows 98 or later
  Windows Installer 2.0 or later
  Display capable of 800x600 with 24-bit colour

Informally: if you have a computer that can't cope with this game,
consider donating it to a museum.


 3. INSTALLING THE GAME

Installing Narcissu Side 2nd is as easy as clicking 'Next'. Just launch
the installer and follow the wizard. You won't need the Japanese game.


 4. PLAYING THE GAME

 4.1 TRANSLATIONS

The first Narcissu game experimentally came in both voiced and
unvoiced versions.  When we localised it, we followed the experimental
spirit and provided multiple translations.  We continue that tradition
in the sequel.

Each translation may additionally be played voiced or unvoiced.  They
are all different presentations of the same games -- finishing a
chapter on one setting unlocks the next chapter for all settings.
All saved games will however be tied to their own settings.

The translation selection takes the form of a brief series of menu
screens each time you start a game.

There are two translations of Narcissu Side 2nd to choose from, and
three of Narcissu:

  Agilis (both games)  -- American English
  gp32 (Narcissu only) -- American English
  Haeleth (both games) -- British English

Each translation is based on different stylistic ideals; if summarized
in a sentence by the translator, they would be:

  Agilis -- "To stay close to the text and recreate the mental
      experience of reading the original."
  gp32 -- Somewhere between the two, in terms of the balance between
      the relationship of the text and rephrasing.
  Haeleth -- "To produce as natural an English script as possible,
      preserving the sense but not always the exact expression."

The translators may provide more details about their translation
ideals for their version in their own notes, which you can find
in-game under the Notes menu.

Also, gp32's script for Narcissu is unchanged from the 2005 insani
release of Narcissu, and had been included for sake of completeness.

 4.2 CONTROLS

 4.2.1 General controls

   Action            Mouse          Keyboard
   -----------------------------------------------
   Quit immediately                 Shift+Q
   Toggle fullscreen                F
 
 4.2.2 Normal reading mode

   Action            Mouse          Keyboard
   -----------------------------------------------
   Next sentence     Left click     Space, Enter
     or screen       Wheel down     Cursor right
   Enter lookback    Wheel up       Cursor left
   Enter menu        Right click    Escape
   Adjust text speed                1, 2, 3
   Toggle page-at-once              O
   Enter autoplay mode              A
   Skip to unread                   S
   Fast forward                     Control

  Most of these controls only work while the game is waiting for input
  (a rotating cursor will display).  While text is actually being
  printed, only the "Next sentence" and "Fast forward" commands are
  enabled, and "Next sentence" causes the remainder of the current
  sentence to display immediately instead.
  
  The text speed settings are in ascending order: 1 is very slow and 3
  is almost instantaneous.  The default is 2.
  
  In page-at-once mode, text is printed at maximum speed, and
  additionally the game only pauses for input at the end of each page,
  ignoring any mid-page pauses.
  
  Skip-to-unread mode is not instantaneous; it is equivalent to
  fast-forwarding to the correct point.  Unlike other aspects of the
  game, each translation records what you've read separately.

  Autoplay mode is described in its own section below.
 
 4.2.3 Lookback mode

  Lookback mode is a special menu-type screen used to review previous
  pages of text.  Two arrows are always displayed at the right of the
  screen: these move back and forwards within the text.  If the text
  contains spoken lines, you can also activate those lines to play the
  voice again.
   
   Action            Mouse          Keyboard
   -----------------------------------------------
   Previous screen   Wheel up       Cursor left
   Next screen       Wheel down     Cursor right
   Select button                    Cursor up/down
   Activate          Left click     Enter
   Exit lookback     Right click    Escape
  
 4.2.4 Menus

   Action            Mouse          Keyboard
   -----------------------------------------------
   Select button                    Cursor up/down
   Activate          Left click     Enter
   Exit menu         Right click    Escape

 4.2.5 Alternative keys

  Everywhere the cursor keys are mentioned above, you can also use
  some alternative keys.  H and L are equivalent to the left and right
  cursor keys, and K/J and P/N are both equivalent to up/down.

 4.3 AUTOPLAY MODE

The autoplay feature can be used to relieve the tedium of constant
clicking.  Press A at the end of a page to enable it.

In autoplay mode, the game waits a variable length of time at the end
of each chunk of text, then continues automatically.  If the text has
an associated voice clip, then the game waits for the voice to finish
before continuing; otherwise the duration is based on the amount of
text that has been printed.  You can scale these delays in the
configuration menu.

Autoplay mode is disabled if you attempt to take any manual action.
  
 4.4 SAVED GAMES

You can save up to 20 positions in the text for later reading.  To
save a position, enter the in-game menu (right click or escape) and
follow the prompts.

Many settings are stored with each save, including the translator and
the presence or absence of voices.

 4.5 CONFIGURATION

The configuration screen can be accessed from the in-game menu.  Most
settings are self-explanatory.

"Autoplay speed" controls the lengths of pauses in autoplay mode,
relative to the number of characters in a page.

By default, the translations include a few explanatory footnotes, and
the opening song in Side 2nd is subtitled.  If you find such things
annoying, you can get rid of them with the Localization options.

 
 5. KNOWN ISSUES
 
 5.1 WIDESCREEN DISPLAYS

Currently there is no specific support for widescreen displays.  The
game is fixed at 800x600 resolution, and you should have black bands
down each side.

If the image is distorted, please consult the documentation for your
monitor and graphics card -- one or the other should provide a
facility for aspect ratio correction.
