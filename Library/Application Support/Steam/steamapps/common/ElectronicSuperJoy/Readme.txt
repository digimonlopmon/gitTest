Hello all!

I wanted to fundraise for Run For The Cure (RunForTheCure.com), so I'm putting ESJ on sale for this weekend
only, with all the money going to Run For The Cure.

As an added bonus, I've asked several game designer friends to donate cool things. They've collected
game design sketches, game docs, art style mockups & prototypes of their hit games, for your enjoyment.

So thanks for buying the game, supporting breast cancer research & enjoy exploring the behind-the-scenes 
game design process of these awesome designers. :)

The game designers are:

- Ron Carmel, known for World Of Goo, with some art style mockups.
- Metanet (Mare & Raigan), known for N++, with notes sketched during N++ development.
- Terry Cavanagh, known for VVVVVV & Super Hexagon. He's donated a super early prototype of Super Hexagon.
- Zach Barth, Zachtronics, known for Infinifactory, TIS-100, SpaceChem & Infiniminer. He's kindly scanned 
in a bunch of his puzzle design notes from SpaceChem.
