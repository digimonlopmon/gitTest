[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Some of it isn't even news. Just #speculations or ...copycats.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I can't read your newspaper's daily #feed without running into at least ONE #article about Alice_Rabbit.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] But not all the daily stories about #murders and other horrors?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well, I always filter out that section. #I don't want to start my day scared and #bitter.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I have enough pressure and problems #as is. I don't need to add Glitch City's #lovely citizens to the list.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Now, you need an elderly woman #carrying a sick baby boy getting hit by a #truck.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Death's not enough. They need a full #sob story behind it.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] That's why I like those urban #legends: they're easier to write about #and you can make up any shit you want.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,shitgrin][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Spam them while they're hot. And #even people like you, people who avoid the #murder stories, will see them.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] That brings money. And like I said, #money's good.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Huh, I guess he has a point...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What about the opinion columns? Aren't #those a good source of traffic too?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Oh, I hate those brats. They just #write about how they're better than #everyone else.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] They might also write about how #everyone that likes a certain something #should be sodomized.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] The worst part about that is they #KNOW half of our clicks come from them so #they get all diva-like on my ass.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I think you're being too harsh. What #about...?[STOPLIP:]

[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] You're not making me feel special, #honey.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] And second, because I'm always up #for gossip regarding famous people.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Especially the red carpet kind of #famous. [XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Those folks people pretend to love #but actually want to see fall from grace.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] "Pretend to love"? "Fall from grace"?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Why do you think that gossip about #famous people always sells?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,shitgrin][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] People pretend that they love #celebs, but what they really want is to see #their idols torn down to their level.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] They want to see them suffer. To get #their comeuppance for daring to be so much #more successful than them![XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Nah, I think gossip is just something #everyone enjoys but nobody wants to admit #to enjoying.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] You thought wrong. But even if you #were right, it wouldn't change the fact #that people love that kind of stuff.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] They want to escape their lives by #living somebody else's.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Sadly, I fail to see the appeal in that #whole thing. [STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What do I care if this guy I saw in #some random movie was wearing socks with #sandals or if they're dating god-knows-who?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Granted, socks with sandals is #practically a public indecency, but #still.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,smile][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Oh, please. As a bartender, I bet #you have a strong voyeuristic streak. Your #kind always loves to hear that stuff. [XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Just like hairdressers! This sounds #hypocritical coming from you.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] E-even if that's the case, I don't #sensationalize what people do.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I don't make it more than "That person #you know from TV acts like a human".[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] "Sensationalize" is the key word #here.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Just the other day, I saw this #"Committee" judge bitching over what some #girl was wearing to the store.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] No matter what you say, these people #don't exist solely to entertain the public.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] But this problem exists because #they're the ones constantly cultivating the #idea that they're perfect and untouchable.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Going to exotic locales, dressing in #elegant ways, indulging in every luxury they #can think of...[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] All that just leaves the public #CRAVING for those little moments when they #make a mistake and fall to their level![XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Can't say that's a lie, but... #sometimes the crowd just wants to #see they're human.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] "Hey! That dude that plays the nice guy #is indeed a really nice guy!"[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] To be fair, the gossip articles #don't help. Sensationalizing everything.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] It feels like they're instigating a #behaviour that shouldn't even be #acknowledged in the first place.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] You like your big words, eh brat?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Well, two can play that game of-...[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] ...[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Hmhm...[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,shitgrin][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Heeeeeey. You're a bartender, right?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] No, I'm a lab rat hellbent on world #conquest.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Sarcasm wastes my time, my money, #and your energy. Refrain from using it.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Anyway, I just realized that a #bartender like you must've heard quite a #few stories in her career.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Talk about changing topics.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Maybe, why?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Wouldn't you like a column talking #about those? I bet they would sell quite #well.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] It would be like that priest who #published "Confessionary Stories"... and #then got excommunicated and lynched.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] People usually tell me all this stuff #because they know I'm just a simple #bartender...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] A personal stranger of sorts.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] We could have you ghostwriting - half #of our staff do that.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] They do?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] You don't really think Lana Smithee #is just one person, do you?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Figures.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] A-Anyway...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Eventually, the people from the stories #would know it's them and blame me.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Not only would that hurt us as a #business, it would hurt me. I really like #hearing clients rant about their lives.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Oh... and it would hurt the clients #too, I guess.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Well, if you ever retire, that offer #is waiting for you.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Yeah, like you'll remember me two #weeks from now.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Sure.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Do you want another drink, Mr. Donovan?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Mister Donovan...[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Mister... Donovan...[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] D-Did I say something wrong?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Not at all. I just really like the #sound of that.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,smile][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Mister Donovan... MISTER #Donovan...[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Is it really that special?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] At work, everyone calls me Mr. Dawson #or Boss.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Boss is just a title. It's too #impersonal and cold.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (It is?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Mr. Dawson was my father and #grandfather. It's too general. But Mr. #Donovan... now that's more like it.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] They're referring to ME. To the man #in front of them. Not to my family. Not to #my position as boss. To ME.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Do you want your employees to get #personal with you, Mr. Donovan?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Oh, gods no. But I want them to fear #ME. Not because I'm their boss or the name #appearing in their paychecks... [XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] ...but rather because I strike #mortal dread into them.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Starting tomorrow, I'm going to make #everyone call me that.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Oh yeah, you were asking something. #What was it?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Drink. Another one. Do you?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Ah yes, yes...[XS:dtalk,0][XS:ph,13][E:25][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] But I need to cut myself off - I #just remembered I have a night shift later.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Give me something bitter... and big, #but not alcoholic. I need to wake myself up.[XS:dtalk,0] [STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I can do that.[XS:mix,1][XS:ph,14][E:26][STOPLIP:]

[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Kid, I just said I needed to stop #the alcohol, not that I needed more.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[RES:][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Here.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Yes, this doesn't have alcohol, but #it's also not what I asked for. What's your #problem?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Don't retort. He's right.)[XS:ph,16][XS:mix,0][E:30][STOPLIP:]

[RES:][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] One Beer.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Yeah, I guess this one's good enough #for now.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[RES:][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Here you go.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] You know, even a blind man could #see this isn't a fucking Beer.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Whatever. At least you had the #decency to put alcohol in it.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:donface,][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Say kid, does this bar have any #investors?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (He didn't call it a hell hole?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] There was some bloke named Sven that #wanted to give us money if we stamped his #face all over the place.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] But aside from that, no.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] These bars are pretty much like any #fast food chain, so there are no local #investors.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Why?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,shitgrin][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Just wanted to let you know how #lucky you bastards are.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Investors suck harder than my first #wife's mouth.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Those bastards think they're #soooooooooo important because they put #their money in the company.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well that's...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] I mean, you give me money so you can #make more. Let me do my thing and I'll give #you your money![XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] But nooooooooooooo, they have to #stick their noses and start changing the #silliest of stuff.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] What good is it to be the boss if #you still have to work for someone else?![XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You still have to answer to unions, the #government, and those kind of organizations, #don't you?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Yeah, but that's paperwork. I make #somebody else do it and call it a day. These #losers ask for "meetings".[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] They start talking about stuff they #don't like, stuff they found offensive... [XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] And there's always that one guy or #gal that says "Hey, why don't you do what #that other newspaper does?"[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Recently they told me that they #needed more clicks. MORE CLICKS! [XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] I make sure to keep stuff spicy #while still keeping production quality up #but it's never enough for them![XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Well, you know what?! They want more #clicks? I'LL GIVE THEM MORE CLICKS! [XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] I'll show them what happens when I #do what they want and don't reject ideas.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] They'll know who the hell DONOVAN D. #DAWSON is.[XS:dtalk,0][XS:donhide,1][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...should I be worried? Nah...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] At least he paid before storming off.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (I wonder what happened with Sven #though. We never heard from him again.)[XS:ph,1][XS:client,2][E:36][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Mr. Donovan, can I ask you something?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Depends on what you're going to ask. #Is it about how to be successful?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Because I'll only spout stuff from #those shitty 'how to get rich' books.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] No, it's not that... well, not exactly. #How did you start in this business?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] The Augmented Eye was a really #important newspaper in Neo-San Francisco #almost 10 years ago.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] But... there was a big mess #involving the head editor being #defenestrated.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] One thing led to another, and during #a tough financial spot, I bought the whole #thing and assumed duties as chief editor.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Neo-SF is still the HQ, but most of #the revenues come from here.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Just being in Glitch City means at #least 30% extra earnings.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Oh yeah, I remember the news. It was #quite a mess.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And what made you pick a news website #as business?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] It sounded fun. I decided it on a #whim - I might as well have ended up with #a hairdressing chain called Marcelo.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Donovan:[C:C] Anyway, I've got to go. Are all the #orders paid for?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Yeah, thank you very much. Please come #again.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (The payment registry says...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Sorry for the question then, Mr. Ingram #McDougal.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Sorry about the smell, we're working on #fixing it. There was an... incident over the #weekend.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] But it's Tuesday.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]

[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] If I pay you, will you come with me #to a motel for a couple of hours?[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] No.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Then I have no use for you beyond #giving me drinks.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Such pleasant clientele tonight...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] May I ask why you decided to come to #our bar then?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Somebody recommended me this place #and I have absolutely no idea why she likes #it.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] She says she's a regular here and all. #I'm starting to doubt her tastes.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] A regular? Can I ask who?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] No.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I'll concede one thing: whoever picks #the music at least has decent taste.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[SHOW:120,sprite_dana][XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Hey Jill, where did you put the dish #soap? Gil's run out.[XS:dantalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Right.[XS:dantalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] Oh! A customer. Good evening, sir. Hope #you enjoy your stay at Valhalla.[XS:dantalk,0][XS:danhide,1][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] So, any other feedback you want to #provide the establishment so we can enhance #your customer experience?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] No... nothing.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That's... an interesting change of #heart.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I can't afford to slander this place #knowing SHE's here![XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You know my boss?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I don't *know* her, but I know who #she is.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Dana Zane, the Red Comet. [XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] The woman who fended off mall rioters #all by herself, knocking them out cold one #by one.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That's... an achievement and a title #I've never heard before.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I know Boss did quite a few things #before opening this bar, but that sounds...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Would you happen to know how she got #her mechanical arm?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I heard a couple of stories but they #sound too fantastical to be true.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] ...[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You've had an interesting change of #attitude.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I saw that woman take out armed #rioters with her bare hands.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Once you see something like that, #it's hard not keep your mouth shut in #front of them.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Interesting...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You can relax, though. I've only seen #her deal with clients personally about two #or three times.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] One involved Class-5 weaponry, the #other one a "pick-up artist", and the #latest had an alpaca.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] An alpaca?[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Not really an alpaca, but...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] There's this woman that owns a textile #company.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] She got really drunk and... she started #screaming she was an alpaca.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] She started spitting on everything #afterwards. My boss had to show her the #exit.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I'd rather not remember that night, so #let's leave it at that.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Can I get you anything else?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Give me a Piledriver, please.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Please? There's a word I haven't heard #today.)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Coming right up.[XS:mix,1][XS:ph,6][E:45][STOPLIP:]

[RES:][XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] This isn't a Piledriver.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] It's a local drink. My coworker came #up with it. He calls it a Suplex.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] It isn't gonna blow up in my face, #is it?[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] No, it's safe. It's even been added to #the BTC's official recipe book.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Good.[XS:intalk,0][XS:ph,7][XS:mix,0][E:47][STOPLIP:]
[RES:][XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] This is not what I asked for.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You look stressed from seeing my boss. #Sweet drinks can help with that.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] You know, all these sweet drinks #remind me of my ex-wife.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] How so?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Whenever she saw me in a foul mood, #she'd take a candy out of her purse and #give it to me.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Then she'd smile and say something #about sweet stuff helping.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Sounds like a nice woman.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] She was nice up until we had our #daughter. A couple of weeks after she gave #birth, she just up and ran away.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Left a note about everything being too #real or something like that.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Then is my serving you sweet drinks #resurrecting bad memories?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Not really. The good times I spent #with her won't go away even if she acted #like a bitch in the end.[XS:intalk,0][XS:ph,8][E:50][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Hey lady, have you ever faked an #orgasm?[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I'm sorry, I think I heard wrong.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I asked if you've ever faked an #orgasm.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That's a question I'm not gonna answer.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I'll take that as a yes.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I was just thinking about how good a #lie can be.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I mean, even the most sincere of #people lie once in a while.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Lies can buy you time. Lies can make #you happy...[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Reality will come crashing through #the door eventually. But for that moment #the lie can give meaning to you.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...I say lies are like your porn stash.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You know they exist but you shouldn't #acknowledge them.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Does that mean you've really faked #orgasms? 'cause you look like you have a #lot of experience.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Still, that's quite the random thought #to just suddenly have.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Are you perhaps lying about something #right now?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Not really, I was just thinking about #people making polite comments about this #crackhouse.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] *sigh* Of course you were.[XS:ph,8][E:51][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Opinion? Can't say I have much of one.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I haven't had enough encounters with #the White Knights to form one myself.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] What if I said one killed my daughter?[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Really?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] It happened about four years ago.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] She was just outside her school when #a chase occurred between a psycho and some #police squad or whatever.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] She just so happened to be in the #wrong place at the wrong time.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What happened?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Sadly, nothing dramatic happened. #Nothing like the psycho taking her hostage #and the squad bulldozing through her.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] The squad passed by her. One of the #members hit her to move her out of the way.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] She knocked her head against a wall #when she fell. Killed her instantly.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] How do you feel about them now?[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...don't take this the wrong way, but #nothing's changed, really.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I haven't interacted with enough White #Knights to form an opinion of my own.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] If I started judging groups based on #only a few examples, I'd be against all #Lilim because one of them went rogue.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Yeah. To be fair, I'm in the same #boat.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Eh?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I wasn't looking for retaliation #against White Knights. Just the faggot that #killed her.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] So, I spent some money to get the #name of the bastard and then some more money #to have him killed.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] The guy I sent brought me his head as #proof and a cycle was closed...[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Hm?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] On one hand, I feel satisfaction #knowing that guy is dead.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] On the other, I feel... empty.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] The hate I felt for that guy, the #sadness for my daughter... all of it gone.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I spent so much time irate that it #kinda burned away any feelings of sadness.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I guess I know how that feels.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Sometimes, something happens and I know #I should feel mad or sad, but I can't muster #it. And that worries me.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I've tried to see if I can stir some #feelings into myself.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] For the past three years, I've hired #this girl to dress up and act like my #daughter for a day. [XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I feel nothing. Nothing at all.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I just wanna be able to cry for my #dead daughter. Is that so much to ask?[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Maybe you shouldn't force yourself.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Emotions will rush in when you least #expect it, and mourning doesn't necessarily #involve lots of tears.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Yeah, maybe I should try that #sometime.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Everything I just said. It could've #been a big fat lie on my end.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I could've also have lied about #lying.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...can't say I particularly have.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] I just feel there's this part of #myself that lacks something.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] An urge to get or do something that #I just can't satisfy.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Have you tried taking up a hobby?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] It might not solve your problems, but #it might keep you busy enough to avoid #thinking about it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Any suggestions?[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well... collecting stuff, reading, #bungee jumping, combat sports, exercising...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Sounds a lot cheaper than the #alternative.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Which is?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:intalk,1][C:21]Ingram:[C:C] Bitches and alcohol.[XS:intalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] *ahem* What made you become a White #Knight instead of a veterinarian or... #anything else?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Well, I was never a good student, so #studying medicine of any kind was out of #the question.[XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] That aside, it's mostly because of #something that happened while I was a kid.[XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] That I wanted to help people the same #way they helped me.[XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh... it's interesting though: one #would think being attacked by a White Knight #would make you run the opposite direction.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Yeah, but it was another one that saved #me.[XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] So I kinda guide myself toward judging #everything on an individual basis. [XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Yeah. I try to do the same too.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Why join the Valkyrie corps #specifically, though?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seiface,][XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Because I wanted to rescue people #from dire situations whenever #possible.[XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Now that I think about it, there are #different kinds of White Knights, right?[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Really?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] Yeah, they get assigned to companies to #handle the accounting and that kind of #stuff.[XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] People usually ask for them because #they speed up processes. [XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] But a few are assigned when a company is #suspected of having weird, under-the-table #deals.[XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Interesting.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] There was also a squad dedicated to #fighting school bullying.[XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] They were doing a nice job, but the #"fad" of anti-bullying campaigns passed #and they lost their funding.[XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] I believe some members still work with #anti-bullying cases in an unofficial #capacity. [XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That'd be nice... I think.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Can I get you anything else?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:seitalk,1][C:17]Sei:[C:C] I don't know if I should. I can't afford #that many drinks. And besides, I don't #really know how much alcohol I can handle.[XS:seitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Yeah, I can see that.[XS:ph,6][E:67][STOPLIP:]

[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] He's so forceful about the things he #wants that people have it done before they #realize what's going on.[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] He even got a pizza delivery boy to #work server maintenance. [XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] A full week passed before the pizza #shop asked where the hell he was.[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] And would you believe it? The guy became #decent at server maintenance, despite having #no previous experience.[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:kimface,mad][XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] It's kinda admirable, but at the same #time I hate his guts! UGH![XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] Knowing that I have to work for him, #it's... AGH![XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] ...[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Did I ask something I shouldn't have?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:kimface,][XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] N-No... don't fret about it. I'd rather #not talk about it, though.[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Fair enough.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] Is it hard to be a bartender, Jill?[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I guess it's as hard as being a cook #somewhere.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You keep going through the motions #while trying to provide something of #quality.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] All while answering the whimsy of #people's orders.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I think the hardest part is dealing #with the chemical hazards some people might #leave behind. Why?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] At one point I thought about being a #bartender... [XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] ...but I was afraid they'd make me wear #skimpy clothes and dance or something.[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Here we go again...)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well, it depends on where you start #working, you know?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I guess I was lucky Valhalla didn't #end up being a tacky disco overseen by a #DJ with an afro.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] My boss just wanted a comfy place, I #think.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] Your boss sounds like an interesting #person. What with wanting to put me #somewhere safe and all that.[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] She is! She's so cool and collected, #but has no qualms about showing excitement #about stuff.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Sure, she's been a bit tense the last #couple of days... [STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] But even then, when you're with her #everything just feels under control.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] She also has this mechanical arm. I #have no idea how she got it, but...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] ...heh.[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (I do that?)[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Shall I call her? She'd be glad to #know you're okay.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] Oh no, I shouldn't pester her that way.[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] And besides, it's getting late and I #don't want to abuse your generosity.[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You can ask for another one, although #I don't know how much alcohol you can #handle.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] Hey Jill, do you work with other women?[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I work FOR a woman, but my only #co-worker is male, why?[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Not really. It just kinda happened.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] Do you regret not fulfilling a dream?[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] The only dream I can remember being #passionate about was buying a Model #Warrior Julianne arcade machine.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:kimtalk,1][C:22]Kim:[C:C] I remember I wanted to live in a Koi #pond when I was seven. The fish seemed to #be having a blast to me.[XS:kimtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
