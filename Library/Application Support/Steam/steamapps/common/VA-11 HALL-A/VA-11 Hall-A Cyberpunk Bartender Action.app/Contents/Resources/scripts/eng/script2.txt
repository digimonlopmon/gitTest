[XS:dantalk,1][C:15]Dana:[C:C] I was just about to ask you where it #came from.[XS:dantalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] A White Knight came yesterday. She #left and... well... she forgot to take it #with her.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I figured she'd eventually come #looking for it so I left it under the #count-... wait.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] True. Morally speaking, I shouldn't #let people get drunk. [STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] How was the interview?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] Easy enough. The fact that the #gal had a nice pair of knockers helped.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] Ten years ago, I tried to start #a silicone business.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] So, I was in Hong Kong talking #with some investors when those damned riots #broke out.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] Seriously, though. Did they #really think the laws they were trying to #pass wouldn't backfire?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] They were openly trying to #segregate people with augmentations![XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] No matter how many "They have #different capabilities" you put in-between, #it's still segregation.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That's a... very laconic way of #summarizing the incident.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I mean, there was a political agenda #revolving around cheap labour.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And the plan reached such a developed #stage because the media was instilling #fear in the public.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] The general fear that augmented people #would become power-hungry maniacs was a key #factor in the plans.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And everything is mostly the aftermath #of previous protests where-...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] On second thought, maybe it's better #to be laconic. [STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Trying to get the full picture might #take you back beyond the industrial #revolution.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] All that happened when I got out of #high school. [STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I remember I had to turn down a #scholarship in Hong Kong because of all that.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] Heh, scholarship. That's no mean #feat, brat.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well, I guess even without the #scholarship, there would have been the #language barrier.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I remember I was kinda excited back #then because I was really into this one #Chinese idol band.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] It's... one of those things I'd rather #not remember much of.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,smile][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] You'd be surprised at how easy #Chinese can be.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] So you know how to speak Chinese?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] The only translator I had #available was some pizza-faced pencilneck.[XS:dtalk,0] [STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] And I wasn't gonna allow myself #to be seen with THAT.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] If someone like me can learn #Chinese in two weeks, well... [XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,shitgrin][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] I'm guessing a scholarship #student might have a chance.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Why do I feel like he suddenly #challenged me to finally learn Chinese?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Chinese?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Wait... when you say "Chinese", do #you mean Mandarin or Cantonese?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] Tangerine? Cantowhat?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] When people say "Chinese," they’re #usually referring to the written word. #Not the spoken one.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] It's important to clarify because #there are lots of dialects in the Chinese #language.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] In Hong Kong, lots of people speak #Cantonese, so just saying "Chinese" won't #do.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You might've learned Cantonese #because you were only going to Hong #Kong.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Or you might've learned Mandarin #because it's the one spoken by the #majority elsewhere...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] I went to Hong Kong and #managed to seal a deal. I have no idea #about anything else.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] R-Right...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] Anyways, surely a student with #a scholarship can serve me a Marsblast #too, right?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] Being offended by a newspaper is #like being angry at the mirror.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] So, I'm a bit interested in this #interview you had. Can you tell me anything #about it?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] You don't run any blogs, right? #No microphones hiding between your boobs?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] ...do you have boobs at all?[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...*cough*[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] There's this one blog I wrote when I #was 12. But it just fills me with shame, #so I try to forget it exists.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] Okay then.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] It started with the same boring #questions.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] How are you, why choose this #place, how's the city, the tour, new single, #blah blah blah...[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] It went by very quickly. It was #the "Regular Interview Stencil," as we call #it in the business.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,smile][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] So I tried some fun questions #afterwards.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] "How big are your tits? Is it #true that you don't wear underwear on stage? #Are you still a virgin?"[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] How did she react?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:donface,][XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] She answered them like it was #the most natural thing on earth![XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] I don't think I wanna know what #kind of questions other people have asked.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] I did it to get a reaction #out of her, but she just took it in her #stride.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] In case you were interested, #the answers were: 91 centimeters, depends #on the costume, and no.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I see.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] Her room backstage was filled #to the brim with gifts of all sorts.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] Dolls, blue roses, chocolates, #fruit. I'm pretty sure I saw at least three #dildos in there too.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] I just finished an interview and #it must be posted as soon as possible.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] The fact that we're posting it #AFTER the chick finished her concert is #enough of a problem already.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Something delayed the interview?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] The interview was supposed to #happen last Friday![XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] One of the interns -- this meek #little girl -- was supposed to do it, but #for some fucking reason, she just didn't.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] I spent two days negotiating #something else instead.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] "Negotiating"... did you have to pay #or something?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] Basically, when that encore #concert happens, I need to plaster that #chick's face all over the front page.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] They only accept people born or #raised in South California and go through #hellish training on a daily basis.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] They have to. No normal person can run #around in swimsuits in this cold weather.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] They have an interesting view on #the world and how it works, but they're #pretty sensitive too.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dtalk,1][C:20]Mr. Donovan:[C:C] Too many outlets have insulted #them in the past, so they are trigger-happy #against defamation.[XS:dtalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Does your boss know about it?[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] She said "I'm not one to judge". Seems #like she knows what the hell's going on.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Did I tell any lies?[STOPLIP:]

[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] The guy paid me to spend ALL DAY #pretending to be his daughter.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Really?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yeah, I go to his house at 11 a.m, #dress as requested and spend all day there.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Play some games, occasionally tell #him I love him, go to bed when ordered, #and leave.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,think][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Nothing sexual. I used to expect #him to push me against the ground and have #his way with me.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But after three years, it's unlikely #that'll happen.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Three years?[STOPLIP:]

[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh, but last year he also wanted me #to play the part on his daughter's birthday.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:doroface,think][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yup. I seem to attract that kind of #people for some reason.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What kind of people?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Nobody. I said nothing.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Hey, did you see something about a #concert outside?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] A concert?[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yeah. Now that you mention it, I #remember seeing a line near the stadium a #couple of blocks away.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] They couldn't take their eyes off #of me, so I took some photos with them.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Oh.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Why do you ask?[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Someone was here just a minute ago. #Seems he was interviewing the star of the #show.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Really? What kind of person is #this star?[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Some girl. He didn't tell me her name.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Seems she's a King-Class CH1A.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,think][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh...[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What's with that reaction?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Nothing, it's just that the CH1A is #the model that comes after mine.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Really?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,angry][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yeah, they think they're so #important because they have more #sensitivity points in their skins.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] And because their voice modulators #are more advanced.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] They do?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,think][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] ...n-no, I'm just kinda jealous #that they do.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I had to mod myself to have what #they have from the get-go, you know?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Wait, they don't make DFC-72s like you #anymore?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,angry][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] My line is quite alive and well, #thank you very much.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] The difference with the CH1A is #mostly that they sacrifice functionality #for appearance.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] They don't have an expansion port in #their heads and their senses and abilities #are more akin to those of humans.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] They're mostly for human #stand-ins, while my line is slightly more #work-oriented.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh, I see.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh yeah, I think I saw the concert #poster outside the bar.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Poster...?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] You work here, you should know which #one![XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I... kinda forget things on that #entryway from time to time. All because #of Didi and Gogo.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Who?[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] The vending machines outside. They #blabber so much I've learned to ignore #anything on the door.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Oh! And here I was wondering why #their volumes were reduced so much.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] They're interesting to talk with, they #just talk... so... much.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You can actually get physically sick #from listening to them for too long.[XS:ph,6][E:30][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] There's something I've been meaning to #ask you...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yes, I'm single and I don't mind #that you're a girl.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Do you actually mind what anyone is?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Not at all.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Anyway, it's not about that...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Do all DFC-72s look like kids?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Yes and no.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Out of factory, we look like kids #because our development needs to be as #close to human as possible.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Then you look like babies outside the #factory?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Nope, every fresh DFC-72 looks about #10 to 13. It makes it easier to upgrade #later.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Upgrade?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Once a DFC-72 passes three #"maturity tests" it can opt for a factory #upgrade. [XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Said upgrade alters its body to #something older.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Some go for it, some don't.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Will you go through it?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,think][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I don't know. Right now, I'm a #rarity.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] You don't find many like me in my #line of work, so I have an advantage.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] And I really need that advantage, #you know?[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] How so?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,think][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] When people hire me, half the time #it's not because I'm me.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] The amount of roleplaying I have to #do on a normal night is ridiculous.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] So, if I stop looking underaged, #I'll lose my advantage over everyone else.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I didn't think about it that way.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] (Should I think about it at all?)[STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I mean, maybe I'll go through with #it if I ever decide to retire or something.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] But right now I'm just fine the way #I am![XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I heard restaurants do that from #time to time.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] The guy made me dress in a school #uniform with a training bra and some bunny #panties.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Then he asked me to stand near the #bed and say "What are we doing for homework #today?"[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I ended up lying on the bed with #this 50-something fucking me like a rabbit, #while shaking me like a ragdoll.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] He started spouting nonsense, like #he was trying to live all of his fantasies #at the same time or something.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] He lasted a long while. I'll give #him that. But I was a mess afterwards.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Ignore her? Take her comments in #stride? Drink even more? [STOPLIP:]

[XS:jamieface,shy][XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Hey Dorothy, may I ask you #something... ah, private?[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,pachi][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] If you need a price list, I have a #convenient card with updated fees![XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I can give you a discount if you pay #for the room or invite me to dinner.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] No, thank you. It's not about that.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Then go ahead! I don't think you #can ask me something I've never been asked #before.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Is it true that the DFC-72 line leaves #tracking nanomachines in the other person #after... well...[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] That's a semi-myth that nobody has #tried to dispel.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] It's true, but also not true at the #same time.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamieface,][XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Care to explain?[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] We do have tracking nanomachines, #but they're released when the body enters #alert mode.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] When we're being assaulted or the #like. That way, the authorities can chase #down the attacker.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,think][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] It's kind of buggy, though. [XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I've heard stories of DFC-72s who #marry, get nervous on their wedding night, #and BAM![XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] Their partners end up spending the #honeymoon in jail.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] I see.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:doroface,][XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] And besides, I've modded myself so #much that if any tracking nanomachines were #still being released...[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] I'd have to commend their tenacity #to be honest.[XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:dorotalk,1][C:18]Dorothy:[C:C] There's also this urban myth that #those nanomachines help improve performance, #but that's just silly. [XS:dorotalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] You know, years ago I met the lead #engineer of the moon cannon.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What kind of guy was he?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] A bit cocky. He said he started the #project to pick up girls.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Apparently he always told them he'd #name it after them.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Seems it was *this* close to being #called the Simonetta cannon instead of the #Selene cannon.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Huh...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] That one poem about it would've been #pretty weird like that.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] "Under the ever-vigilant eye of #Simonetta" doesn't have the same ring #to it.[XS:mix,0][XS:ph,4][E:43][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Mercury... it was such a mystical #metal ages ago.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Well, if you saw a liquid that's all #silvery and shiny, you'd think there's #something mystical about it.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I think there was a Chinese emperor #that died from drinking mercury mixed with #powdered jade.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] That would cause liver failure, #mercury poisoning, and brain death.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Hey, are there many gun-for-hire types #in this city?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Not really. There's maybe two girls #and three guys, myself included. Why?[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Yesterday, there was this client #talking about how a White Knight killed #his daughter.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Said he sent someone to "take care" of #the guy. That the hire brought back the #guy's head.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] So, I wanted to know if it sounds #familiar to you.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Hm... can you give me the guy's #name?[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I'd rather not. No offense.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] I think I know the guy that handled #that job.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Something wrong?[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I just realized how easy it is for me #to get ahold of dangerous information from #dangerous people.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] None taken.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] It was easy because I know you won't #do anything with it.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jamieface,surprise][XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Something wrong?[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I was just thinking how troublesome #it'd be for common people to get rid of a #human head.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] There's something I've been wondering #for a while now.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] What could that be?[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] First it was how a professional #assassin could be so polite and pleasant #to be around... [STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] ...but I guess your line of work #doesn't have to have any bearing on your #personality.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamieface,][XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Thanks a lot.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] What I've often wondered about is how #you can be so calm here?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Aren't you worried about police or the #like?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Well... first of all, I try to keep #everything as clean as possible.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Second, I don't come here looking for #trouble, so I don't raise suspicion.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] And finally, you can thank your boss #for easing my mind about other folks.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You... wouldn't happen to know how #she got her mechanical arm, would you?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] I heard she lost her original #fighting a cyborg wrestler that had gone #rogue.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Just a rumor, though.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Damn... I still don't know, then.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] Have you tried asking her?[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] She told me "It's more interesting if #it's left a mystery."[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Which leads me to believe that she #might have started some of the rumors #herself.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jamietalk,1][C:23]Jamie:[C:C] They're believable because she's her.[XS:jamietalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Maybe I'll see her in action one day.[STOPLIP:]

[RES:][XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Here.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:mikitalk,1][C:42]*Kira* Miki:[C:C] This is good, but it isn't #exactly what I needed.[XS:mikitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And what did you need?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:mikitalk,1][C:42]*Kira* Miki:[C:C] Something that'll wake me up, #or help me sober up a bit before going #back.[XS:mikitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] You could've said so earlier and I #would've fixed you something like that.[STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Why the change?[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] Going from jazz and piano to idol...[STOPLIP:]
[XS:mikiface,][XS:mikitalk,1][C:42]*Kira* Miki:[C:C] Have you ever thought about the #power music has over people?[XS:mikitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:mikitalk,1][C:42]*Kira* Miki:[C:C] You could argue it's just #noise, but it can make you feel a wide range #of emotions.[XS:mikitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:mikitalk,1][C:42]*Kira* Miki:[C:C] And that power is universal. #It can transcend language and culture.[XS:mikitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:mikitalk,1][C:42]*Kira* Miki:[C:C] Being in a jazz band or #performing recitals, I can only take that #power to so many people.[XS:mikitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:mikiface,smile][XS:mikitalk,1][C:42]*Kira* Miki:[C:C] But being an Idol, I can take #that power and spread it far and wide![XS:mikitalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I'm not picky, but I do prefer versions #with no lyrics.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:mikitalk,1][C:42]*Kira* Miki:[C:C] Why?[XS:mikitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I like to listen to music while #working, and lyrics distract me.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] And besides, it always bothers me #when people nonchalantly start singing songs #with creepy lyrics.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I think only half of the listeners #actually care about what's being said.[STOPLIP:]
[XS:mikitalk,1][C:42]*Kira* Miki:[C:C] Oh, that's a bummer.[XS:mikitalk,0][STOPLIP:]
[XS:mikitalk,1][C:42]*Kira* Miki:[C:C] I'd give you a copy of my latest #CD, but I don't have any at the moment.[XS:mikitalk,0][STOPLIP:]

[XS:jilltalk,1][C:13]Jill:[C:C] I'm surprised you remember all those #names.[STOPLIP:]
